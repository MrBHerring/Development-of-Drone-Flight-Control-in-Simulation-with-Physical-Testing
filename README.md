# Development-of-Drone-Flight-Control-in-Simulation-with-Physical-Testing
Development of Drone Flight Control in Simulation with Physical Testing Repository

Project overview
	AI also known as Artificial intelligence is known as the next wave of programming. Artificial intelligence is a type of program that is capable of handling a situation that usually takes a human level of understanding to solve. In a world full of innovation our team's goal is to harness the usefulness of AI to monitor items in remote places using a drone. In reality, there’s many places that physical humans are unable to reach without costly transportation or dangerous conditions. With AI drones it will allow our team to solve these problems. The goal is to allow the drone to fly and detect items with an almost human level of understanding of what it's looking at. 

Background Information
	Creating an AI base model from real life is a big jump. The goal for our team is to create a simulation through an unreal engine that allows us to mimic a real life environment with more consistent variables. There are 3 programs we’ll use  which we will use to do so; Unreal Engine,Visual studio, and Blender. Unreal Engine is a 3D computer graphic game system. It’s known mostly for game developers. Unreal the software allows us to run the simulated AI environment with the drone inside. Visual studio is an integrated development environment. Visual studio is used by programmers. We will be using Visual Studios to code the AI for the drone. Blender is a 3D computer graphics software. This is what will be used to create the environment for unreal. 
Goals
1)	Research background information and get basic understand of project requirements
2)	Purchase needed equipment/ software 
3)	Get the platforms running on each computers, set  up communicate with each other
4)	Set up a basic environment
5)	Get the drone operational
6)	Incorporate AI code to recognize environment
7)	Fine tune and clean up needed areas 
8)	Incorporate into a real life model/examination. 

Software and Hardware Specifications
	Software needed for us to be able to complete our task is  minimum windows 7. The computer must have at least 8gb of ram available. These are the only main requirements. The processor is important if it's not up to date because the simulation will run slow and lag. Reducing the efficiency of debugging our program. The other 2 software being used are Unreal Engine, Blender, and Visual studios. 
Main Milestone
I.	Complete project Proposal 
This would describe everything that we want to accomplish with the project. The background research was just getting a basic understanding.
II.	Download and setup unreal environment
	We were only able to get unreal up and running on certain computers. This took us 
	All a while to figure out. Bryce was the one with the most compatible computer so 
	He is mostly in charge of managing all the code
 

 	
III.	Imported drone 
	In this step we imported the drone and figured out how to control it.
 

IV.	Incorporated Blenders landscapes
Once we figured out all of the basics of the unreal engine it was time to incorporate our own designs in order to test our AI. Bryce and Edward were mostly in charge of figuring out how to get them into the Unreal Engine. Timothy helped with the design in blender.  




V.	Started AI modeling 
This is our current step. We've been sent a link by Dr.Bhattacharya which explains how we should get started on the task. 

Teams Current progress
	The Team's main goal right now is to get AI detection in the code. We are able to get pictures to be taken by the drone. The drone can now solar cells within the simulation as Dr.Bhattacharya has requested. In the future, we will obtain an AI model to train so the drone can detect solar cells within any flat surface simulation.
What we’ve learned so far
	So far we have learned the basics of how an unreal engine works. We also learn how to incorporate different code to get it to what we want. We go there to take pictures, move, and detect the solar cell. We are still currently learning the AI part 
Each team member Contribution 
Timothy (estimated contribution 30%) : He is responsible for designing maps/objects, assisting with code, and finding information on how to control drones. He has installed airsim and unreal engines. He assisted with main coding implementations for both engines.  

Bryce (estimated contribution 40%)  has installed two programs called airsim and unreal engine. He has created a simulation that allows him to fly a drone in real time. Drone flight is only possible when using code implementation. With the code Bryce had found throughout his research, he had successfully programmed the drone to take off and travel any direction he wished for it to go using keyboard inputs. Furthermore, Bryce had programmed the drone to take images while it flies or remains stagnant in one position. Most importantly, any object that is detected by the drone (e.g. cylinders, and solar cells) Bryce was able to capture the images and save the detected objects within his file

Edward (estimated contribution 30%) Edward has worked with 3D objects quite extensively on Blender. Providing the group with solutions to technical difficulties with importing 3D objects into Unreal Engine, Preparing solar cells and searching for 3D flat surfaces for use in Unreal Engine. He has also worked with Bryce to solve any benchmarks that were preventing the project from moving forward and overall has provided a support role in keeping the team productive and on task
